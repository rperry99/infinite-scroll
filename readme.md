### Infinite Scrolling Website

This project was for me to learn how to create a website that will continously load photos as you scroll.

### Thoughts

This is a pretty useful skill to learn I think. A lot of websites today use infinite scrolling, or lazy loading, to constantly show new items / elements to a user. This eliminates the need for pagination and can make browsing easier.

### Important Note

This project does not have a live version for you to look at. This project requires an API key that I do not want to share publicly. If you would like to try this app out for yourself, feel free to clone it or download it.
