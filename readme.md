# Infinite Scrolling Website

This project was for me to learn how to create a website that will continously load photos as you scroll.

This project is from [Zero to Mastery: Jacascript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects).
This is project 2 / 20.

## Thoughts

This is a pretty useful skill to learn I think. A lot of websites today use infinite scrolling, or lazy loading, to constantly show new items / elements to a user. This eliminates the need for pagination and can make browsing easier.

## Live Version

You can view a live version [here](https://russ-infinite-scroll.netlify.app/). If you would like to run this locally, you will need an API key, which you can get for free from the steps below.
